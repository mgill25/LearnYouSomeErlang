# Learn you some Erlang

These are the code exercises and notes taken during my reading
of the book [Learn You Some Erlang](http://learnyousomeerlang.com)

If anyone stumbles across this and is curious enough to read the code,
feel free to hit me up to talk about it, point errors, suggest alternatives
etc. :)
